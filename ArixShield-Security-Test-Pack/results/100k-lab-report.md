## Scope and limitations

- All checks are local/in-process; this is not a live network, browser, database, or cloud-provider test.
- Precision/recall describe this generated corpus and these explicit labels only; they are not population-wide production estimates.
- The image and ZIP helper vectors exercise library inspectors directly, not the full upload pipeline or a production malware sandbox.
- Parser differential cases are simulated request metadata; no real HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, proxy, or origin parser pair is deployed here.

This report is a reproducible local test run, not an ASVS certification, penetration-test attestation, production block-rate guarantee, or proof of zero vulnerabilities.
